This research project aims to gauge how Americans perceive various tactics used by social movements, such as marches or civil disobedience. The main objectives are to identify which strategies are seen as the most disruptive and which ones are considered most effective in bringing about meaningful change. Additionally, the study seeks to understand the relationship between the perceived level of disruption caused by these tactics and their effectiveness. We also intend to explore how these perceptions vary based on individuals' political views and socioeconomic status.

By examining these connections and attitudes, this project sheds light on the intricate dynamics that influence social movements' impact on American society. Ultimately, it contributes to a deeper understanding of their role in promoting positive changes within our society.
