abstract: 'Previous research demonstrates that while the stigmatization of fandom members has decreased over time, many members, especially ‘fangirls’, continue to be stigmatized and treated negatively. Additionally, fandom research has traditionally focused on ‘fanboys’ regardless of the major contribution and leading role fangirls have played in shaping fandom communities. This study focuses on the One Direction fandom which largely consists of fangirls who pioneered the use of Twitter for fandom. In this research, I utilize in-depth interviews with members of the One Direction fandom on Twitter in order to answer the questions: “how do fans navigate and mediate their fandom experiences?” and “how do fans connect with each other in online fandom spaces?” Isolationary practices take up huge portions of respondents’ mediation and navigation of the fan community. The practice of isolation both from outsiders and people within the community are important for the respondents’ to form connections in the community. Out-group isolationary practices are learned through the experiences individuals have with people outside of the community and the stigmatization of fans and fangirls common in society. This stigma coupled with many finding solace within the community as a safe-space for queer identities, many find themselves being more hesitant to form social connections completely removed from the community. In-group isolation includes practices that individuals take to protect themselves from other portions of the community and to make sense of the community as a whole. This takes the form of both negative views of the majority of the community, large levels of curation, and creating bubbles acting as microcosms of the overarching fandom community.'
