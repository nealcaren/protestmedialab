abstract: U.S. federal climate investments have begun to reshape policy coalitions around green economic transition. One accomplishment is to bridge labor unions and environmental organizations as fellow beneficiaries of recent federal climate legislation, but discursive visions among movement leaders are unclear amidst transitioning economies. I assess how forty-five movement leaders in North Carolina labor unions and environmental organizations vary in depth and breadth of intersectional visions around a green jobs frame. Bridging institutional logics and collective action frame theories, I analyze how movement leaders within their institutional contexts employ distinct cultural logics to make sense of and evaluate a green jobs frame. Preliminary findings underscore that movement leaders typically employ either a constituency-servicing logic or a social-transformation logic with each composed of distinct schemas associated with a green jobs frame. Leaders who employ a constituency-servicing logic typically engage in either frame resonance or dissonance while those who employ a social-transformation logic engage in frame extension. Most labor leaders in building trades and manufacturing sectors engage in frame resonance by orienting a green jobs frame as enabling union members to adapt to new green economic opportunities. In contrast, most environmental leaders engage in frame extension by re-articulating green jobs to address intersectional and progressive political projects. Service sector labor leaders employ wider varieties of cultural logics towards more diverse frame resonance, dissonance, and extension outcomes. Findings underscore distinct discourses from green economic transition that facilitate and constrain labor-environmental coalitions and collective action around climate justice.
