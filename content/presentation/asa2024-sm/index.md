abstract: 'How does social media use impact patterns of unequal protection and harm at a U.S. public flagship university? Social media and U.S. public flagship universities both hold unrealized democratizing potential, in practice forcing marginalized groups to confront disadvantage and non-belonging while sheltering privileged groups from confronting unearned advantages. Through 51 semi-structured interviews with U.S. emerging adults attending a selective public flagship university in the Southern United States, I find social media amplifies the accumulation of legitimating symbolic capital among students historically served by the university while simultaneously amplifying exposure to delegitimizing symbolic violence among students historically barred from the university. Social media’s documentary capacities allow affluent peer networks to hoard attention and prestige through online overrepresentation and collective “hyping up” while marginalized students face non-recognition and invisibility. Marginalized students’ negative emotional responses to structural inequities broadcast on social media are construed as individual character flaws, and their lives are considered less worthy of online documentation by affluent and marginalized students alike. Though marginalized students adopt strategies resisting digital symbolic violence, these strategies require undue vigilance not similarly demanded from advantaged students. My findings highlight the amplification of inequalities through evolving legitimation processes across two increasingly linked institutional domains.'
