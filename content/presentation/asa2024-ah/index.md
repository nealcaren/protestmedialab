abstract: Right-wing social movements often communicate their ideologies to the public through their own right-wing media ecosystems. Alternatively, leftist social movement actors have no comparable, explicit leftist media ecosystem to communicate their ideologies to the public, forcing these movements to engage with a mainstream, corporate press corps who may often ignore, fail to deeply engage with, or broadly water-down left-leaning social movement ideologies. How do left-leaning social movement actors maneuver this phenomenon and what tactics do they use to navigate a two-pronged battle of breaching both the public and the press? Literature covering social movements and political sociology tells us that while media can marginalize or disparage leftist movements, movements still need the media to convey their message to the public and receive validation for their work. But in a unique era of political polarization and corporate media conglomeration, does this remain true? Or has the relationship between mainstream media and leftist social movements changed? Using 35 qualitative interviews and fieldnotes from participant observations, I examine the broad political arena of leftist social movement spaces across multiple field sites in the Southeastern U.S and observe how these movements interact with the press. Two analytic themes emerge from this ethnography that are largely supported by existing literature, including “hyper-confrontation” between the media and movements as well as the “strength of alternative media.” But a third theme of “intentional evasion,” sparsely found in social movement scholarship, shows the ways in which leftist social movement actors may see avoiding the press altogether as a strategy to maneuver this phenomenon. Taken together, these qualitative findings paint a contemporary picture of how the tense relationship between media and leftist social movements operates today, by both confirming existing scholarship and empirically exposing new aspects of this struggle.
