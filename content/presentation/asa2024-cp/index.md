abstract: 'This study uses data from Wave 7 of the World Values Survey to investigate the relationship between economic class and attitudes toward “degrowth” across eight countries. “Degrowth” refers to an ideological movement within social science and ecological research which argues that current economic growth-oriented conceptions of human development are both unavoidably harmful to the environment and poor measures of human prosperity, especially considering global inequality. Therefore, degrowth advocates support a political, economic, and cultural shift away from productivist and consumerist ideologies and policies, and toward global egalitarian and sustainable practices. Critics argue that degrowth policies would struggle to cultivate the political support necessary to be implemented, especially among wealthier individuals and within high-income countries. However, few studies have examined attitudes toward degrowth across national contexts and in consideration of potential class dynamics. This paper seeks to expand our knowledge of attitudes toward economic growth and environmental sustainability across national and economic contexts. Using logistic regression models to analyze survey data from the United States, Germany, Iran, China, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and Ethiopia, this study finds that there is broad support for environmental protections at the expense of economic growth across the globe. Though middle-class and college-educated individuals are generally more likely to express pro-environmental sentiments, results from analyses of these attitudes within particular national contexts reveals that that relationship between class and environmentalist values varies considerably between countries.'
