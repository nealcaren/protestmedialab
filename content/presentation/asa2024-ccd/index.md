abstract: 'The digital era has seen the rise of both feminism and anti-feminism as transnational movements with a global impact. While feminist activism has utilized online platforms to expand its reach, foster cross-border communication, and mobilize support, anti-feminism has developed its own networks to propagate counter-narratives. The affordances of information technology have not only facilitated the spread of these movements, but also increased their popularity and visibility among the general public. This study aims to examine the cross-country diffusion of public interests in feminism and anti-feminism, with a particular focus on English-speaking countries. By leveraging digital search data from Google Trends as a proxy for public interests, the study has a two-fold contribution: first, to create a unique dictionary that encompasses both feminist and anti-feminist terms; second, to map out the online spread of these terms across various countries. My key research question investigates how public interests in feminist and anti-feminist movements manifest and spread online. Specifically, which keywords are more likely to gain prominence in the digital search space, and which are more prone to diffusion? To my knowledge, this study provides the first systematic analysis to trace the dissemination of online interest by using related search queries from Google Trends. Situated at the intersection of social movements and digital technology, this paper seeks to expand both areas of scholarship by delineating the transnational patterns of public interest.'
