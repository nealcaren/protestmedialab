abstract: 'When and how can movements for racial justice impact policies regulating police? Beginning in 2013, high-profile cases involving fatal police shootings of unarmed Black men, women, and children have led to grassroots protests across the globe and elevated the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement into the international spotlight. The use of deadly police force, documented by cell phone and body cameras, and circulated via social media, propelled millions to demonstrate. We ask whether and to what extent protests and social movements like BLM have contributed to changes in policies regulating the police. This paper presents a comparative analysis of police policy reforms in the 89 largest U.S. cities between 2010 and 2022. Our project uses computational methods to construct a comprehensive dataset of BLM protests. We have also collected and validated indicators of eleven policies across three major domains: (1) officer training, (2) policing practices and techniques, and (3) accountability and transparency. Alongside movement characteristics, we test the extent to which reform adoption depends on the political context and institutional characteristics of police departments. We find substantial increases in policies across all cities. However, the pattern of adoption is consistent with a national diffusion process rather than being responsive to local protest, political institutions, or population characteristics. Drawing on interviews with stakeholders in eight cities we highlight the ways that different actors express support for policies in general but articulate significant skepticism about their potential efficacy. Finally, we return to our quantitative data to consider whether policy reforms may alter patterns of police violence.'
