abstract: 'Why do social movement organizations sometimes gain professional news coverage that is good for them, but sometimes receive news that hurts them? To answer the question, we go beyond the literature’s standard case studies by analyzing the news treatment of the 100 most-covered U.S. movement organizations in the twentieth century, as well as four case studies of highly covered Black rights organizations in their heyday. We argue that the main reason behind the organization’s newsworthiness shapes its news treatment, regarding the substance and sentiment of articles from four news sources. We appraise these arguments through a variety of techniques, notably employing AI methods, along with topic modeling, natural language processing analyses, and hand-coding. Preliminary regression analyses on the articles that were hand coded support the arguments, even when including other potential influences over the amount and quality of news attention. We have had some success with gaining valid measures of substance through ChatGPT (GPT-4), designing prompts that have matched the hand-coding. For the meeting, we plan to extend the preliminary analyses from hand-coding reported here with many additional cases gained through the AI results.'
