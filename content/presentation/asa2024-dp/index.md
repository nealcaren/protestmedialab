abstract: 'In recent years, a wave of labor organizing among graduate student workers has swept across the United States. Confronting escalating precarity, rising costs of living, and a deteriorating post-graduation job market, graduate student workers are increasingly uniting to demand higher wages, better benefits, and improved working conditions. In fact, since 2016 tens of thousands of graduate student workers at dozens of large US universities have won union recognition. Despite this surge of union activity, few studies have explored the factors leading graduate student workers to participate in labor organizing efforts. What are the determinants of union involvement among individual graduate student workers? To answer this question, this study will conduct 40 in-depth, semi-structured interviews of graduate student workers as well as several hours of participant observation of union events. Preliminary results indicate that four social psychological factors spur activism: First, altruistic motives drive graduate student workers to participate in the union to fight for changes that will benefit others but not themselves. Second, instrumental self-interest compels graduate student workers to become involved to address specific workplace problems they have faced. Third, graduate student workers join due to leftist views, general pro-union attitudes, or other ideological reasons. Fourth, a desire for community motivates graduate student workers to participate in the union with the hopes of fostering social connections. After discussing avenues for future research, I conclude with the scholarly and practical implications of these findings.'
